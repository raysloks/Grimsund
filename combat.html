<h1>Basics</h1>

<h2>Strike</h2>
<p>Make a Melee Offense test versus the target's Melee Defense.</p>
<p>This test is special. If you roll a natural 20 you automatically succeed. If you roll a natural 1 you automatically fail.</p>
<p>If you succeed, your attack hits and you deal your weapon's damage dice to the target.</p>

<h2>Shot</h2>
<p>Make a Ranged Offense test versus your target's Ranged Defense plus 1 per 10 paces the target is further than your weapon's mid range.</p>
<p>This test is special. If you roll a natural 20 you automatically succeed. If you roll a natural 1 you automatically fail.</p>
<p>If you succeed, your attack hits and you deal your weapon's damage dice to the target.</p>

<h2>Movement</h2>
<p>Most movement in combat occurs through the actions Charge, Stride, and Sprint.</p>

<h1>Turns</h1>
<p>At the start of a time-critical encounter, every player rolls a d20 to use as their Initiative. This value may be modified by various abilities, but it is always a value between 1 and 20.</p>
<p>Regardless, record the result as your Initiative. You could do this via sticky notes or some sort of dry-erase stuff.</p>
<p>The players begin taking turns, starting at the highest Initiative.</p>

<blockquote>TODO when you start dying or something, move Initiative to right before whosever turn it is right now. This way your allies get a whole round to save you. Grabbed from Pathfinder 2e.</blockquote>

<h1>Actions</h1>
<p>Every turn you may take one action.</p>
<p>Note that the actions listed here are not an exhaustive list.</p>

<h3>Melee Attack</h3>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>Make a Strike against an adjacent target.</p>

<blockquote>Going back and forth between having this be a contest, or having it as a test.</blockquote>

<h3>Ranged Attack</h3>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>Allows Opportunity Attacks.</p>
<p>Make a Shot against a target in range.</p>

<blockquote>Requires more research, refining, and testing.</blockquote>

<h3>Sprint</h3>

<blockquote>Is this description clear? It may need refining.</blockquote>

<h1>Reactions</h1>
<p></p>

<h1>Momentum</h1>
<p>When you hit an attack, you gain a stack of momentum.</p>
<p>Each stack of momentum grants you a +2 bonus to any combat related rolls.</p>
<p>You can normally have up to 3 stacks of momentum.</p>
<p>If you miss an attack or get hit by an attack, you lose all stacks of momentum.</p>

<h1>Flanking</h1>
<p>If there is only one enemy adjacent to you, you are marking that enemy.</p>
<p>If a marked enemy "allows Opportunity Attacks" from you, you may make an Opportunity Attack against them.</p>

<h1>Opportunity Attacks</h1>
<p>An Opportunity Attack, also known as an attack of opportunity, is for most purposes a free Strike that may be made under a few circumstances.</p>

<blockquote>Considering adding a penalty to opportunity attacks made after the first in a round. Perhaps even all opportunity attacks.</blockquote>

<h1>Damage</h1>
<p>A hit will always deal at least 1 nonlethal damage, even if it is reduced to 0 or below by Armor or such.</p>
<p>If the attacker has 3 or more stacks of momentum after hitting, it also inflicts a minor wound.</p>
<p>If a hit reduces the target to 0 hit points, or they were already at 0 hit points, it inflicts a major wound. If the hit would already inflict a wound, it inflicts a fatal wound.</p>
<p>A hit can only inflict a single wound.</p>

<h2>Nonlethal</h2>
<p>Can never inflict fatal wounds and always uses the unarmed wounds table.</p>

<h1>Wounds</h1>
<p>Minor wounds will never incur permanent penalties.</p>
<p>Major wounds may incur permanent penalties, and have a low chance of being fatal if not treated.</p>
<p>Fatal wounds are almost always, as the name suggests, fatal.</p>
