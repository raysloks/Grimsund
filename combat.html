<h1>Actions</h1>
<p>Every turn you may take one action and one half action.</p>
<p>You may freely exchange one action for two half actions and vice versa.</p>

<h2>Melee Attack</h2>
<p>Make a Melee Attack contest versus your target's Melee Defense.</p>
<p>This contest is special, in that you rolling a natural 20 means you automatically win, and you rolling a natural 1 means you automatically lose.</p>
<p>If you win, you deal your weapon's damage dice to the target.</p>

<h2>Ranged Attack</h2>
<p>Making a ranged attack provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>

<h2>Move</h2>
<p>Move 6 paces.</p>

<h2>Recover</h2>
<p>Regain 1d6 + Constitution hit points, but you need to make a Constitution save or gain a stack of Exhaustion.</p>

<h2>Half Actions</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Sprint</h3>
<p>Move 1d6 paces.</p>

<h2>Reactions</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Attack of Opportunity</h3>
<p></p>

<h1>Momentum</h1>
<p>When you win a contest versus an opponent, you gain a stack of momentum.</p>
<p>Each stack of momentum grants you a +2 bonus to any combat related rolls.</p>
<p>You can normally have up to 3 stacks of momentum.</p>
<p>If you lose a contest, you lose all stacks of momentum.</p>

<h1>Flanking</h1>
<p>If there is only one enemy adjacent to you, you are marking that enemy.</p>
<p>If a marked enemy makes a melee attack against someone other than you or is the target of a melee attack, you may make an attack opportunity against them.</p>

<h1>Damage</h1>
<p>An attack that hits will always deal at least 1 damage, even if it is reduced by armor.</p>
<p>If an attack rolls the maximum value on any of its damage dice, it also inflicts a minor wound.</p>
<p>If an attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, it inflicts a major wound. If the attack would already inflict a wound, it inflicts a fatal wound.</p>
<p>An attack can only inflict a single wound.</p>

<h2>Wounds</h2>
<p>Minor wounds will never incur permanent penalties.</p>
<p>Major wounds may incur permanent penalties, and have a low chance of being fatal.</p>
<p>Fatal wounds are almost always, as the name suggests, fatal.</p>
