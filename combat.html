<h1>Actions</h1>
<p>Every turn you may take one action.</p>

<h2>Melee Attack</h2>
<p>Make a Melee Attack test versus your target's Melee Defense.</p>
<p>This test is special. If you roll a natural 20 you automatically win. If you roll a natural 1 you automatically lose.</p>
<p>If you win, you deal your weapon's damage dice to the target.</p>

<i>Going back and forth between having this be a contest, or having it as a test.</i>

<h2>Ranged Attack</h2>
<p>Make a Ranged Attack test versus your target's Ranged Defense plus 1 per 10 paces the target is further than your weapon's mid range.</p>
<p>Making a ranged attack provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>

<i>Requires more research, refining, and testing.</i>

<h2>Move</h2>
<p>Move up to 5 paces.</p>

<h2>Recover</h2>
<p>Regain 1d6 + Constitution hit points, but you need to make a DC 16 Constitution save or gain a level of Exhaustion.</p>

<h2>Sprint</h2>
<p>Move up to 1d6 + 5 paces.</p>
<p>Make a DC 16 Constitution save or gain a level of exhaustion.</p>

<i>May be a bit slow to make two separate rolls when recovering or sprinting. Testing required.</i>

<h2>Charge</h2>
<p>Move up to 5 paces towards a target and make a melee attack against it.</p>

<h1>Momentum</h1>
<p>When you hit an attack or an attack against you misses, you gain a stack of momentum.</p>
<p>Each stack of momentum grants you a +2 bonus to any combat related rolls.</p>
<p>You can normally have up to 3 stacks of momentum.</p>
<p>If you miss an attack or get hit by an attack, you lose all stacks of momentum.</p>

<h1>Attacks of Opportunity</h1>
<p>An attack of opportunity is for most purposes a free melee attack that may be made under a few circumstances.</p>

<i>Considering adding a penalty to attacks of opportunity made after the first in a round. Perhaps even all attacks of opportunity.</i>

<h1>Flanking</h1>
<p>If there is only one enemy adjacent to you, you are marking that enemy.</p>
<p>If a marked enemy makes a melee attack against someone other than you; is the target of a melee attack; or uses the Sprint or Charge action, you may make an attack of opportunity against them.</p>

<h1>Damage</h1>
<p>An attack that hits will always deal at least 1 damage, even if it is reduced by armor.</p>
<p>If an attack rolls the maximum value on any of its damage dice, it also inflicts a minor wound.</p>
<p>If an attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, it inflicts a major wound. If the attack would already inflict a wound, it inflicts a fatal wound.</p>
<p>An attack can only inflict a single wound.</p>

<i>The rule for how minor wounds occur is the one part I am unsure about. It gives daggers and such a larger chance to inflict a minor wound, which I guess makes sense. But I'm not sure that's what I want.</i>

<h2>Wounds</h2>
<p>Minor wounds will never incur permanent penalties.</p>
<p>Major wounds may incur permanent penalties, and have a low chance of being fatal if not treated.</p>
<p>Fatal wounds are almost always, as the name suggests, fatal.</p>
