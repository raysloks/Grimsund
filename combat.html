<h1>Basics</h1>

<h2>Strike</h2>
<p>Make a Melee Offense test versus the target's Melee Defense.</p>
<p>This test is special. If you roll a natural 20 you automatically succeed. If you roll a natural 1 you automatically fail.</p>
<p>If you succeed, your attack hits and you deal your weapon's damage dice to the target.</p>

<h2>Shot</h2>
<p>Make a Ranged Offense test versus your target's Ranged Defense plus 1 per 10 paces the target is further than your weapon's mid range.</p>
<p>This test is special. If you roll a natural 20 you automatically succeed. If you roll a natural 1 you automatically fail.</p>
<p>If you succeed, your attack hits and you deal your weapon's damage dice to the target.</p>

<h2>Movement</h2>
<p>Most movement in combat occurs through the actions Charge, Stride, and Sprint.</p>

<h1>Turns</h1>
<p>At the start of a time-critical encounter, every player rolls a d20 to use as their Initiative. This value may be modified by various abilities, but it is always a value between 1 and 20.</p>
<p>Regardless, record the result as your Initiative. You could do this via sticky notes or some sort of dry-erase stuff.</p>
<p>The players begin taking turns, starting at the highest Initiative.</p>

<blockquote>TODO when you start dying or something, move Initiative to right before whosever turn it is right now. This way your allies get a whole round to save you. Grabbed from Pathfinder 2e.</blockquote>

<h1>Actions</h1>
<p>Every turn you may take one action.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Melee Attack</h3>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>Make a Strike against an adjacent target.</p>
<p>Allows Opportunity Attacks, except from the target.</p>
<p>Your target also allows Opportunity Attacks, except from you.</p>

<blockquote>Going back and forth between having this be a contest, or having it as a test.</blockquote>

<h3>Ranged Attack</h3>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>Make a Shot against a target in range.</p>
<p>Allows Opportunity Attacks.</p>

<blockquote>Requires more research, refining, and testing.</blockquote>

<h3>Stride</h3>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>Move up to 5 paces.</p>

<h3>Recover</h3>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>Regain 1d6 hit points, but you need to make a DC 16 Constitution save or gain a level of Exhaustion.</p>

<h3>Sprint</h3>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>Move up to 1d6 + 5 paces.</p>
<p>Make a DC 16 Constitution save or gain a level of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Allows Opportunity Attacks from anyone you move away from or pass on the way.</p>

<blockquote>May be a bit slow to make two separate rolls when recovering or sprinting. Testing required.</blockquote>

<h3>Charge</h3>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>Move up to 5 paces towards a target and make a Strike against it.</p>
<p>Allows Opportunity Attacks from anyone you move away from or pass on the way.</p>

<h3>Hold</h3>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>Put your turn on hold. After another player's turn you may interject, resuming your turn then.</p>
<p>Holding your turn does not change your Initiative.</p>
<p>You must finish your held turn before you can take your next turn.</p>
<p>Hold refunds the action spent on it when you resume your turn.</p>

<blockquote>Is this description clear? It may need refining.</blockquote>

<h1>Momentum</h1>
<p>When you hit an attack or an attack against you misses, you gain a stack of momentum.</p>
<p>Each stack of momentum grants you a +2 bonus to any combat related rolls.</p>
<p>You can normally have up to 3 stacks of momentum.</p>
<p>If you miss an attack or get hit by an attack, you lose all stacks of momentum.</p>

<h1>Flanking</h1>
<p>If there is only one enemy adjacent to you, you are marking that enemy.</p>
<p>If a marked enemy "allows Opportunity Attacks" from you, you may make an Opportunity Attack against them.</p>

<h1>Opportunity Attacks</h1>
<p>An Opportunity Attack, also known as an attack of opportunity, is for most purposes a free Strike that may be made under a few circumstances.</p>

<blockquote>Considering adding a penalty to opportunity attacks made after the first in a round. Perhaps even all opportunity attacks.</blockquote>

<h1>Damage</h1>
<p>An attack that hits will always deal at least 1 damage, even if it is reduced by armor.</p>
<p>If the attacker has 3 or more stacks of momentum after hitting the attack, and the attack dealt more than 1 damage, it also inflicts a minor wound.</p>
<p>If an attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, it inflicts a major wound. If the attack would already inflict a wound, it inflicts a fatal wound.</p>
<p>An attack can only inflict a single wound.</p>

<h2>Wounds</h2>
<p>Minor wounds will never incur permanent penalties.</p>
<p>Major wounds may incur permanent penalties, and have a low chance of being fatal if not treated.</p>
<p>Fatal wounds are almost always, as the name suggests, fatal.</p>

<h1>Reactions</h1>
<p></p>

<h1>Conditions</h1>
<p></p>

<h2>Stunned</h2>
<p>May not take any actions or reactions.</p>
<p>Attacks against stunned targets are treated as though the attacker has 3 stacks of momentum.</p>

<h2>Prone</h2>
