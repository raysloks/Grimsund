<p>So how does magic work?</p>
<p>Like, that's a pretty big question.</p>

<p>I want to have that feel of GREEN, ADVENTURE, WEIRD AND ODD BUT NOT TOO MUCH.</p>
<p>What exactly does that mean?</p>

<h1>Titans</h1>
<p>I'm okay with titans as an origin for magic and what not.</p>
<p>It's sort of like the "the gods are the source of all magic" but at the same time, titans don't have the same connotations as gods, so i feel like i can do more of the things i want to do.</p>

<p>I struggle with striking a balance between "science magic" and "handwave magic". Dunno exactly how descriptive these terms are. But I think they get my feelings across decently.</p>

<p>So the titans left behind... what?</p>
<h2>Remnants</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>What are they? Many different things. Wow, that's very specific.</p>
<p>Would it help if i designed like 6 different titans? So i could then more easily imagine parts of them specifically being left behind?</p>
<h3>Function</h3>
<p>What do they do? You guessed it! Many. Different. Things.</p>
<p>However, if you got one lying around in a forest it's gonna have an effect on the environment.</p>
<p>Like a drop of burning titan blood is probably gonna set fire to the forest first of all.</p>
<p>If it landed in a lake, that lake might just become a giant steam vent or something. Maybe get fish "swimming" around in the steam, driven mad by the titan's influence.</p>
