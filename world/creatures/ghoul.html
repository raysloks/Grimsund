<h1>Ghoul</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>At a glance it looks like a pale and emaciated man. A closer look will reveal large pitch-black eyes and lips peeling back from a gaping maw, filled with rows upon rows of mismatched teeth. It's hands are splayed open at awkward angles, its fingers replaces by long, black claws.</blockquote>
<p>Occasionally, when someone dies after succumbing to cannibalism due to hunger, they rise again as a ghoul.</p>

<h2>Behaviour</h2>
<p>Almost all ghouls make their presence known to their prey before attacking them, oftentimes by simply standing in the middle of the road. Once spotted, it does not visibly react. However, within less than a minute of being sighted, it will either attack without warning, or retreat just as suddenly.</p>
<p>A ghoul will generally try to escape when outnumbered 3 to 1, unless it is frenzied.</p>
<p>If a creature suffers a physical wound, any ghouls in the area become frenzied.</p>
<p>A frenzied ghoul will recklessly move towards and attack the closest wounded creature.</p>
