<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>If a player attempts an action where the outcome is not certain, the referee should ask the player to make a test.</p>
<p>The referee may specify any stats or skills that might apply to the test. Usually, one stat and one skill should be selected.</p>
<p>The player may then argue that another stat or skill would be more applicable in the current situation.</p>
<p>Note that players should never ask to make a test; the referee is almost always the one to call for a test.</p>
<p>However, if a player thinks the referee missed calling for a test, they are encouraged to speak up. This shouldn't happen too often, of course.</p>
