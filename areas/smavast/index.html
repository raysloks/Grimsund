<h1>Smavast</h1>
<p>Bordered on most sides by great mountains, the kingdom of Smavast enjoys a moderately peaceful existance. Notwithstanding the constant threat of seafaring raiders, orc invasions, and the possibility of a new war with the empire.</p>
<p>The king of this land claims to hail from the legendary dragon-slayers of yore, holding court in the capital of Drachenheim.</p>
