<h1>Rolling vs Picking</h1>
<p>I would argue that rolling is superior, but you have my fullest support if you choose to pick instead.</p>

<h1>Stats</h1>
<p>For each of your character's seven primary stats, roll 3d6 and use the middle value as your stat.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use a stat block.</p>

<h1>Race</h1>
<p>Pick a race or roll on this table.</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>d20</th><th>Race</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1-15</td><td><a href="races/human.html">Human</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>16</td><td><a href="races/kobold.html">Kobold</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>17</td><td><a href="races/goblin.html">Goblin</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>18</td><td><a href="races/orc.html">Orc</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>19</td><td><a href="races/dwarf.html">Dwarf</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>20</td><td><a href="races/elf.html">Elf</a></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Adjust your stats based on your race. Stats labeled as 'Half' or 'Third' are rounded up.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Roll or select a background appropriate for your race. Relevant tables can be found on your race's page.</p>
<p>This will determine your starting <a href="careers.html">career</a>.</p>
<p>Gain the career's free advancements.</p>
<p>Roll once on the career's stat advancement table.</p>
<p>Select one of the career's available perks.</p>
<p>Gain the career's <a href="equipment.html">Equipment</a>.</p>

<h4>Please be patient while the career system is being finalized</h4>

<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>Roll or select an area from which you hail.</p>
<p>Gain the skill Local Knowledge for that area.</p>

<h1>Connections</h1>
<p>Randomly determine two of your party members.</p>
<p>For each of them, roll on this table to determine how the two of you know each other.</p>
