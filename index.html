</ul>

<p></p>

<h1>Character Stats</h1>
<p>While a character is so much more than just stats, they </p>

<h2>Primary</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Strength</h3>
<p>Attacking.</p>
<p>Carrying stuff.</p>

<h3>Agility</h3>
<p>Avoiding attacks.</p>
<p>Moving about.</p>

<h3>Dexterity</h3>
<p>Using weapons.</p>
<p>Precise fingerwork.</p>

<h3>Constitution</h3>
<p>Taking a beating.</p>

<h3>Intelligence</h3>

<h3>Wisdom</h3>
<p>Instincts, common sense, and willpower.</p>

<h3>Charisma</h3>
<p>Social skills, controlling how others see you.</p>

<h2>Secondary</h2>
<p>These stats are derived from your primary stats, your perks, and your equipment.</p>

<h3>Hit Points</h3>
<p>Your base hit point total is equal to:</p>
<p>5 + Constitution</p>

<h3>Armor</h3>
<p>Every point of Armor reduces the raw damage you take by 1.</p>

<h3>Melee</h3>
<p>Your base Melee Offense is equal to:</p>
<p>(Strength * 2 + Dexterity) / 3</p>
<p>Your base Melee Defense is equal to:</p>
<p>10 + (Agility * 2 + Dexterity) / 3</p>
<p>These are rounded to the nearest integer.</p>

<h4>Unarmed</h4>
<p>If you are unarmed, you have a -6 penalty to Melee.</p>

<h3>Ranged</h3>
<p>Your base Ranged Offense bonus is equal to your Dexterity.</p>

<blockquote>This is most certainly gonna be changed to something else.</blockquote>

<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>You can normally put up to 4 ranks into a skill.</p>
<p>The first rank allows you to make relevant Skill checks without a -6 penalty.</p>
<p>Each subsequent rank grants a +2 bonus.</p>

<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p></p>

<h2>Rolling Dice</h2>

<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>Roll a d20 and add any relevant modifiers.</p>
<p>A test may use a stat; a skill; both; or neither as modifiers.</p>
<p>If the result is larger than or equal to the check's Difficulty Class, you succeed at the test.</p>
<p>An average check has a DC of 16.</p>
<p>Tests are sometimes referred to as checks or saves.</p>

<h3>Contests</h3>
<p>Roll a d20 and add any relevant modifiers.</p>
<p>Your opponent does the same.</p>
<p>Whoever has the largest result wins.</p>
<p>If both results are the same, nothing happens most of the time.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Increase one Primary Stat by 1.</li>
    <li>Increase Hit Points by 1.</li>

    <li>Gain one skill rank.</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot advance a primary stat past 9. Racial modifiers affect this number; for example: an orc can advance their Strength all the way to 12, but their Dexterity is limited to 6.</p>
